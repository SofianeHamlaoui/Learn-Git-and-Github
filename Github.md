**1. Describe the existing technical student communities on your campus. Who is served? Where are there gaps?**

> Our project is to teach, help learn and improve students new skills on the Computer Science field.
> For that we are creating an Open Source Community (dzCode ) that knows how to contribute, use Open Source projects and even benefits from the them. 
> But before doing that people have to learn how to use and be comfortable with Git and Github, that's why I'm applying for this so I can teach them and help them understand and "mindset" of the Open Source.
> So for me it's not only about a **campus**, but a whole **country** ( Algeria ) were we don't have a lot of Open Source users and contributors, So why not starting by teaching them the utility of it and how Open Source is leading the future.

**2. Choose one GitHub Education program. How could it support your on-campus student communities?**
Certainly the Github Education Pack.

> As new learners, the Github Education Pack is just the perfect choice with what it provides as tools and offers what new students will need, especially for a country like Algeria where they can't really offer what can Github give them with this pack.

**3. What would you need to do in order to support the growth of student tech communities on campus?**

> We are by building a community, for the moment we are trying to collect resources and materials to start teaching them how Open Source works, then building projects together where everyone can help build and improve.
> So we are so hyped for this to help grow a big tech community that loves and uses Open Source projects as solutions.
