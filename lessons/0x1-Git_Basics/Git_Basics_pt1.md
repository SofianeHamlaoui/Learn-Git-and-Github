# 0x1.2 : Git Basics pt. 1

As you have seen on the lesson [0x0](lessons/0x0-HelloWorld/HelloWorld.md) on how to create a repository.

Today you will learn how to initialize and use some basic Git commands on a repository.

To do that, Open a terminal and follow these steps : 

-   1 - Make a directory by the name of your repository. 
    ```
    mkdir MyNewRepository
    ```

    2 - enter the folder and initialize it.
    ```
    git init
    ```
    >   so you can use this command to initialize your repository.

    3 - Create a file named `Readme.md`
    ```
    touch Readme.md
    ```
    4 - get the status of your repository
    ```
    git status
    ```
    > As you can see here, git status will give you the status of your commits, tracked, and untracked files
    -   Commit = a changed file that you sent to the staging area.
    -   Tracked = a file that is waiting for commits.
    -   Untracked = a changed file that wasn't sent to the staging area yet.

    5 - Add the `Readme.md` file to the staging area.
    ```
    git add Readme.md
    ```
    6 - Commit that staged file, and add a comment to it.
    ```
    git commit -m "Adding Readme File"
    ```
    -   -m "The comment you want to give to that comment".
        -   Do a git status to check if the commit was done.

    7 - Use git log, to get the logs and check whaat was changed
    ```
    git log
    ```
